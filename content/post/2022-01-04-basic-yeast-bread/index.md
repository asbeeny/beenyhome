## Ingredients

|        |                            |
|-------:|:---------------------------|
| 430 g  | bread flour                |
|   8 g  | instant yeast              |
|  12 g  | kosher salt                |
| 350 mL | water 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) |

## Procedure

1. Stir ingredients in a large bowl until well incorporated. Cover and let rise in a warm room (75&ndash;85&deg;F) for two hours. Halfway through the rising time, preheat a dutch oven with lid at 500&deg;F (260&deg;C) for at least 30 minutes.
2. When the dough has doubled in size, move onto a floured pizza peel and shape into a round.
3. Scrape dough onto a sheet of parchment, drop into the dutch oven, and replace the lid.
4. Lower the oven temperature to 450&deg;F (232&deg;C) and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove the lid and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
5. Let bread cool completely on a wire rack and store in a bread bag.

If baking multiple loaves, raise the oven temperature back to 500&deg;F (260&deg;C) and heat the dutch oven and lid for 15 minutes.
